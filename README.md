These codes show my work in the Kaggle competetion: iMet Collection 2019 - FGVC6  
In this competetion, the deep learning framework I used is called Fastai. Fastai is a deep learning library based on pytorch framework. Fastai is very convenient to apply in deep learning tasks like computer vision.  
In the final evaluation, I ranked 71st among all 521 global competetors, and got a bronze medal, which is my third bronze medal I received in Kaggle competition.  
  
Here I show some part of my work with descriptions:  
fastai-resnet101-imet-7fold-example.ipynb: This script shows how I establish and train the deep learning network based on 7-fold cross-validation of the inputs. In the competetion, I trained two networks: One is resnet50, the other is inceptionresnet.  
total-model-submission.ipynb: This script shows how I validate the test dataset by combining the training results of resnet50 and inceptionresnet. This script is also the final submission script in the competition.  
easy-71st-0-626-7fold-fastai-incepresv2-resnet50.ipynb: This script illustrate how to combine the former two script together and show the connection of the training and validation process with detailed descriptions.
